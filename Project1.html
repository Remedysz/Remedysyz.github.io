										<p>Overall, this was my favorite project so far. We worked with Shaw to provide a conference room kiosk that integrates with their Google Suite platform and provide analytics on room utilization through machine learning. </p>
										<p>Our group decided to create a web application for the specifications using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. The web application handles getting all the event information from their room resources within their Google suite. It also changes the interface dependent whether there is a meeting in place at the time of running. The user interface was modeled after their kiosk already in place which was a service they subscribed to offered by Robin Powered. A program ran 5 minutes before meetings and recorded people (using a webcam) entering and exiting the room for up to 10 minutes into the meeting. Afterwards, we called on the trained model to count the number of people entering the room by using OpenCV and Python then export that data to an XLS sheet for comparison viewing between how many people signed up to go to the event and how many were actually there. </p>
